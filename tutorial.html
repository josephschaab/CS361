            <p>The Objective of Blackjack is to 
                Beat The Dealer. That is the goal of each round of gameplay.
                How do you beat the dealer? You can beat the dealer by: 
                1) By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value.
                2) By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
                3) By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.
                How do you lose to the dealer? you lose to the dealer by:  
                1) Your hand value exceeds 21.
                2) The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round.
                Here is additional information on the rules of blackjack:
                Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.
                2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
                Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
                Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.
