            <h2>Hit or Stay?</h2>
            <p>The buttons above indicate your option to either hit or stay
                at any instance during the game. Selecting the "Hit" button will 
                deal an additional card to your hand. This option is good when the 
                sum of your cards is low and you need to get a sum closer to 21
                to beat the dealer. Be careful however, because if you hit and your
                sum of cards is greater than 21, then you will automatically lose
                the hand. Selecting the "Stay" option is good when the sum of your
                cards is close or equal to 21. If the sum of your cards equals 21, 
                you should always stay! Be careful selecting the stay option since 
                you have selected it, you will no longer be able to hit.
